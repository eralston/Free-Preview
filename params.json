This \"free preview\" mode demonstrates the application to them as-if they were logged in, which may help overcome any shyness they have to signup for your app.\r\n\r\nWhat Does This Module Do?\r\n---------------------\r\nThis module provides a toolkit of action filters for ASP.Net MVC, plus a few extension methods for ControllerBase, that setup and manage preview sessions using cookies and entity framework to provide a consistent context for your user during a \"Preview Session\".\r\n\r\nIf you think using the \"Authorize\" action filter is a simple way to restrict logged in users, you'll feel right at home using the action filters in FreePreview to do things like \"StartSession\", \"EndSession\", and \"AuthorizeOrPreview\" to control access to your app while providing a \"no login demo\" mode.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
